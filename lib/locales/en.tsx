      go_Help_Center: "Go to Help Center",

      learners_question_One: "What’s a learning project, and how will it help me?",
      learners_answer_One: "A learning project is a goal-driven activity you design around something you want to master — like building an app, creating a podcast, or learning a new skill for work. Instead of passively watching videos, you’ll work step-by-step with resources, AI tools, and mentors to create something tangible while learning in the process.",

      learners_question_Two: "How do I begin my learning journey?",
      learners_answer_Two: "Sign up for free, choose your learning goal, and explore project ideas or create your own. UNI Learn will guide you through a quick onboarding process to match you with the right mentor, resources, and tools so you can start making progress right away.",

      learners_question_Three: "What’s included in the free trial?",
      learners_answer_Three: "Your free trial includes full access to our project builder, AI tools (coming soon), and mentor booking system. You can start one learning project, chat with potential mentors, and explore our resource library — all before deciding on a paid plan.",

      learners_question_Four: "What topics or skills can I explore?",
      learners_answer_Four: "You can learn almost anything here — languages, career skills, creative arts, tech, business, or personal growth. UNI Learn’s open project system means you decide the topic, and we connect you with mentors and resources to make it happen.",

      learners_question_Five: "How do payments and subscriptions work?",
      learners_answer_Five: "Choose a monthly plan that fits your needs. Subscriptions give you access to projects, AI tools, and mentor booking credits. Payments are processed securely through Stripe, and you can cancel anytime before your next billing date.",

      learners_question_Six: "Can I make money from my projects?",
      learners_answer_Six: "Yes! Some learners create projects that generate income — like selling a product, launching a service, or building a portfolio that leads to paid work. We also showcase outstanding projects to our community, which can bring you new opportunities.",

      learners_question_Seven: "What if I get stuck or need guidance?",
      learners_answer_Seven: "If you hit a roadblock, you can reach out to your mentor, use our community chat, or get AI-powered tips in the project builder. Our support team is also available to troubleshoot technical issues or help you find the right learning path.",

      learners_question_Eight: "How is mentorship here different from other platforms?",
      learners_answer_Eight: "On UNI Learn, mentorship is about collaboration. Mentors help you design, refine, and complete your project instead of delivering fixed lessons. They adapt to your goals, give actionable feedback, and keep you accountable so you stay motivated.",


      mentors_question_One: "Who can become a mentor?",
      mentors_answer_One: "Anyone with solid skills, knowledge, or real-world experience can become a mentor — whether you’re a professional, creative, entrepreneur, or lifelong learner. If you can guide someone through a project and offer constructive feedback, you’re qualified to apply.",

      mentors_question_Two: "Why mentor on UNI Learn?",
      mentors_answer_Two: "You’ll help learners achieve meaningful goals, build your teaching portfolio, and earn income on a flexible schedule. By creating high-quality learning projects, you can also generate passive income — learners can keep enrolling in your projects long after you’ve built them. It’s a powerful way to showcase your real expertise while UNI Learn handles the tech, payments, and learner matching.",

      mentors_question_Three: "What do mentors actually do?",
      mentors_answer_Three: "As a mentor, you’ll work with learners to set goals, plan projects, and troubleshoot challenges. You provide insights, feedback, and accountability — making sure the learner is supported from start to finish.",

      mentors_question_Four: "How can I earn money here?",
      mentors_answer_Four: "You earn income in two ways:\n\n1. Active mentoring — through one-on-one sessions.\n2. Passive income — from learners who purchase your ready-made, high-quality learning projects.\n\nThis means your expertise can keep generating earnings even when you’re not actively teaching.",

      mentors_question_Five: "How will learners find me?",
      mentors_answer_Five: "We don’t assign learners to mentors. Once your application is approved, your profile is published on the platform for learners to browse. They can select you based on your skills, experience, and availability. Your published learning projects are another powerful way for learners to discover your expertise and decide to work with you.",

      mentors_question_Six: "When and how will I get paid?",
      mentors_answer_Six: "All learner payments are processed by UNI Learn and added to your mentor account. You can withdraw your available funds between the 15th and 25th of each month. You never have to chase clients for payment.",

      mentors_question_Seven: "Can I set my own schedule?",
      mentors_answer_Seven: "Yes! You choose when you’re available and how many learners you take on. You can mentor full-time, part-time, or just a few hours a month — whatever fits your schedule.",

      mentors_question_Eight: "What support and resources will I get?",
      mentors_answer_Eight: "UNI Learn provides onboarding guidance, a mentor toolkit, project templates, and ongoing support. We don’t provide fixed textbooks or pre-made learning materials — that’s intentional. We want mentors to focus on understanding each learner’s real needs, goals, and preferred resources, rather than following a one-size-fits-all curriculum. We strongly recommend using the Project Builder with your learners to plan, track, and manage their learning journey together.",

      mentors_question_Nine: "What payout methods are available?",
      mentors_answer_Nine: "Currently, mentors are paid through PayPal, making it easy to receive funds wherever you are. Payouts are available during our monthly withdrawal window — between the 15th and 25th.",
